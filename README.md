# IIAG-CoFlow: Inter-and Intra-channel Attention Transformer and Complete Flow for Low-light Image Enhancement
## Introduction
IIAG-CoFlow is a novel normalizing ﬂow learning
 based method IIAG-CoFlow for low-light image enhancement
(LLIE), which consists of an inter-and intra-channel attention
Transformer based conditional generator (IIAG) and a complete
ﬂow (CoFlow). **Experiments show
that IIAG-CoFlow outperforms existing SOTA LLIE methods
on several benchmark low-light datasets.**
## Evaluation Metrics

(We remove the GT correction operation when obtaining the metrics of LLFlow for fair comparison. The enhanced image of SMG is with the size 512×512×3 that is different from the original ground truth (GT) image of each testing set, we rescale the enhanced images of SMG to have the same size with the original GT image of each testing set for fair comparison.)
